**Employee Burnout Analysis and Prediction:**

The project focuses on predicting employee burnout using regression analysis. Burnout is a critical issue in workplaces, manifesting as physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion due to prolonged stress. This initiative aims to analyze factors that influence burnout and develop a predictive model to proactively identify employees at risk. By leveraging data-driven insights, organizations can address burnout effectively, enhancing employee well-being and productivity.

**Key Steps in the Code:**

1.Data Import and Initial Exploration:

  The dataset is loaded using pandas and explored (df.head(), df.tail(), df.describe(), 
  df.info()).
  Checked for null values and unique column values.
  
2.Data Cleaning:

  Dropped missing values (df.dropna()).
  Removed irrelevant columns like Employee ID and handled date/time data from Date of Joining.
  Encoded categorical variables using one-hot encoding (pd.get_dummies).

3.Feature Engineering:

  Added a new column to calculate the number of days since a reference date (Days).
  Calculated correlations between features and the target variable (Burn Rate).

4.Data Visualization:

  Visualized the distribution of categorical columns using seaborn bar plots.
  Explored correlations to identify key predictors.
  
5.Model Preparation:

  Split the dataset into features (X) and target (y) and performed a train-test split (70-30 
  ratio).
  Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.
  
6.Model Training:

  Created an instance of the LinearRegression class and trained it using the fit method.
  
7.Model Evaluation:

  Used metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute 
  Error (MAE), and R-squared score to evaluate the model.

**Modules:**

1. Data Manipulation:

  pandas: Data cleaning and manipulation.
  
2. Visualization:

  matplotlib.pyplot: For creating plots.
  seaborn: For advanced data visualization.
  
3. Machine Learning:

  sklearn.model_selection.train_test_split: Splits the data into training and testing sets.
  sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler: Scales numerical features for regression.
  sklearn.linear_model.LinearRegression: Implements the regression model.
  sklearn.metrics: Evaluates model performance.
